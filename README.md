This is a verilog module for use with the DE-10 Lite FPGA (top-level design not included). This is part of a lab 
assignment for my Digital Logic class in which we were tasked with driving the hex displays
on the DE-10 Lite using the 10 switches as input.

Part of the challange of this lab is to use two's complement and display a negative hexidecimal representation of
 the 10-bit input when appropriate.

Version 1.1:
Driving the displays is working, however there is a bug with displying the negative values.
